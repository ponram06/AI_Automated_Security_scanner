 # AI_Automated_Security_scanner

AI Automated Security Scanner is a prototype cybersecurity application that combines automated vulnerability scanning with AI-driven analysis. Designed with a modern user interface, it allows users to configure scans, select vulnerability types, and generate professional reports with ease.



#KEY FEATURES

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive dashboard for configuring scans and monitoring results.

Crawling Options: Supports standard and deep crawling for comprehensive site analysis.

Vulnerability Detection: Identifies common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.

AI-Enhanced Analysis: Provides context-aware insights into detected vulnerabilities using language models.

Reporting: Option to generate structured PDF security reports for documentation.

Configurable Options: Users can choose vulnerability types, enable or disable AI analysis, and adjust scan depth.



#TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend: Modern UI for scan configuration and results visualization.

Backend: Python-based scanner with modular design.

Libraries: requests, urllib3, reportlab, and related dependencies.

AI Integration: Supports integration with external AI APIs for vulnerability analysis.

Platforms: Tested on Windows 10/11, compatible with Linux.
